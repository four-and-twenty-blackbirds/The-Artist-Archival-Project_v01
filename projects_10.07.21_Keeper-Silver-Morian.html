It is decorated with half-uncial calligraphy, watercolor and inked images inspired by medieval artwork. Artwork includes several shield devices, a rapier's helmet, weapons such as a bow and arrow, dagger, axe, rapier, and swords, words in german on curled scroll pieces, and decorated in black, red, and white flowers."

				Keeper of the Silver Morian<br />
				Ink and watercolor, with white and gold acrylic on pergamenata, 11"x7"
				<br />
				by Megan McC of the Barony March of Mons Tonitrus, Oct. 2021

			<p class="project-description">
				In this example, I created a grid with a 1/2" margin, 1/8" ruled lines
				for calligraphy, and made space for the relevant devices being used,
				which are approximately 1" square.
				<br /><br />
				The left and right sections were divided by a 1/4" gutter. The left
				section was reserved for calligraphy and a decorated capital 'K',
				roughly 1" square, while the right section was divided into quadrants
				for the artwork.
